Project Name: Customer Churn Analysis
Languages & Tools Used: Python, Matplotlib, Pandas & NumPy
Insights:
        A) Customer Churn Prediction: Conducted detailed analysis on customer churn data, identifying that 26.5% of customers were likely to churn, and developed insights into patterns
                                      related to tenure and monthly charges.
        B) Data Segmentation & Visualization: Created customer tenure groups and visualized churn patterns across different age groups, with a focus on high-churn segments.
        C) Behavioral Insights: Identified key customer attributes affecting churn, such as senior citizens, customers without partners, and those on monthly contracts or
                                using electronic checks, which exhibited higher churn rates.
        D) Payment Method Analysis: Analyzed churn based on payment methods, finding that customers paying via electronic check had significantly higher churn compared to
                                    those using automatic payments.
        E) Correlation & Trend Analysis: Demonstrated a positive correlation between monthly charges and total charges, and identified that higher monthly charges were
                                         associated with higher churn risk.
